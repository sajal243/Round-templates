## THEORY:

The conversion of AC into DC is called Rectification. Electronic devices can convert AC power into DC power with high efficiency
Consider the given circuit. Assume the diode to be ideal i.e. Vf  = 0,  Rr =ï‚¥, Rs  = 0. During  the positive half cycle, the diode is forward biased and it conducts and hence a current flows through the load resistor. During the negative half cycle, the diode is reverse biased and it is equivalent to an open circuit, hence the current through the load resistance is zero. Thus the diode conducts only for one half cycle and results in a half wave rectified output.
