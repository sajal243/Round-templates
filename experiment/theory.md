## THEORY:

The conversion of AC into DC is called Rectification. Electronic devices can convert AC power into DC power with high efficiency
Consider the given circuit. Assume the diode to be ideal i.e. Vf  = 0,  Rr =ï‚¥, Rs  = 0. During  the positive half cycle, the diode is forward biased and it conducts and hence a current flows through the load resistor. During the negative half cycle, the diode is reverse biased and it is equivalent to an open circuit, hence the current through the load resistance is zero. Thus the diode conducts only for one half cycle and results in a half wave rectified output.

<b>Filters:</b>

The output of a rectifier gives a pulsating d.c. signal (Fig.1) because of presence of
some a.c. components whose frequency is equal to that of the a.c. supply frequency. Very
often when rectifying an alternating voltage we wish to produce a "steady" direct voltage free
from any voltage variations or ripple. Filter circuits are used to smoothen the output. Various
filter circuits are available such as shunt capacitor, series inductor, choke input LC filter etc.
