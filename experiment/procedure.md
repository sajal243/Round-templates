## PROCEDURE for real experiment:
1.	Make connections as per the Circuit Diagram.
2.	Note down the AC and DC Voltages and Currents without Filter and with Load.
3.	And again observe the AC and DC Voltages and Currents with L & ÔÅê Filters and with load.
4.	Observe the Voltage across the secondary of the Transformer.

## These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator
1. After going through the theory and pretest, click the "Simulation" tab
2. The simulator will display the interactive questions, attempt the questions
3. Click "Submit" button to verify the answers given, click on simulator button to skip the test and go to simulator.
Note the result of quizes of the experiment .
