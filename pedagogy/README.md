#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation and Data Analysis
a) Students must be able to understand the working of Half Wave Rectifier and they will learn how to calculate Ripple factor.<br>
b) Students will be able to visualize and understand Half Wave Rectifier and its circuit diagram and how the Rectification occurs.<br>
c) In this experiment, Student will be taken some readings and try to analyse the data (for e.g. Mathematical analysis - peak current and peak voltage , Graphical analysis).

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator opens the quizes on  screen | This will test the understandindg of experiment of student
2.| Student solve the quizes | Simulator provide quizzes on screen one by one | This will test the understandindg of experiment of student
3.| On completion student submit quizzes | Simulator show the results and correct answer| Student will be able to judge our knowledge.
